# Cryptocurrencies Analysis

### Purpose of the Cryptocurrencies Analysis
The goal of this project was to use unsupervised machine learning to create a report on cryptocurrencies currently available on the trading market and group the results together for the Accountability Accounting board. 

During this process we:

- Preprocessed the data
- Reduced the data dimentions using PCA
- Clustered the cryptocurrencies using KMeans
- Created visuals with the cryptocurrency results

### Results
Our analysis gave us 532 tradeable cryptocurrencies. We created a table with all the tradable crypto currencies. We the scaled that data and used the scaled data frame to create a scatter plot of the results.
